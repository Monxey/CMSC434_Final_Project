Horizontal Design Discussion:
Throughout the design process, our team had gone through a few ideas in terms of
how to create the style of our website. Our low fidelity prototypes in phase 1.1.3
discussed some ideas for our tabs and the overall look of our app. The main home
app showcased our idea for the workflow of the user. However, it seemed that
pressing an icon to go to one page and going back to a home page led to a poor
workflow, so we decided to make our medium fidelity prototype have a tab based
system. This improved the workflow of moving between features of the app and
kept everything local, so the user could change their tab with fluidity. Additionally,
our team also needed to decide a color palette for our new prototype, so we decided
to go for a clean teal look using the color palette generator for visual appeal. This
choice of color palette was chosen as it culturally resembled health and well being.
In our Lo-Fi prototype, we used icons for the various features/tabs for our apps. In
our medium fidelity prototype, we continued this idea by using simple and
consistent icons for tabs so the user can manage their workflow and focus on
specific features related to diet, fitness, goals, and progress. Additionally, these
icons were chosen to be easily interpretable. To further communicate the current
feature, each page has a header to uniform the user which tab they are on in case
they do not understand the meaning of the icon. We did migrate some of the
original design ideas involving goal and fitness tracking to our new prototype as
well. The UI is slightly different for the goal tab because we added a way to add
the goals rather than just view them. Additionally, we kept a way for the user to
complete their goals by clicking a checkbox and then deleting them once they wish
to remove them from the screen. Throughout the entire design process, we
prioritized simplicity by minimizing the amount of clicks and information entries
needed for completing tasks. For the fitness tab, we prioritized the users ability to
add an exercise and changed up the UI elements to decrease the economy of
elements. The way the user adds an exercise is also consistent with the way they
can add a meal or goal. Finally, for the progress feature, we wanted a simple design
where the user can see a graph based on the feature they choose from a drop down.
We also label the graph so the user can see what they are looking at. Specifically,
we label the x and y axis where the x axis is composed of dates over time and the y
is the specific measure of the selected option. So far the user can view their overall
strength, calorie intake, water intake, and miles walked/ran on the daily over the
course of a week, month, or year. Overall, we focused on consistency in terms of 
our UI designs. The button colors, fonts, and layouts were kept simple and
consistent throughout the design. 

Vertical Design Discussion:
Current Design Strengths:
The app follows a vertical organization principle that aligns well with how users
naturally interact with mobile and desktop interfaces. The tab-based navigation
system, accessed through the top menu buttons, creates a clear hierarchical
structure where each major function (Profile, Goals, Fitness, etc.) is separated into
its own distinct vertical space. This prevents cognitive overload by showing only
one section at a time.
The profile system is particularly well-implemented, allowing users to maintain
multiple separate profiles with their own associated data. This vertical separation
of user data means that family members or different users can share the device
while maintaining their individual health tracking information. The profile selector
at the top provides clear visual feedback about which profile is active, and the
consistent application of this profile context across all tabs (goals, fitness tracking,
etc.) maintains a coherent user experience.
Design Rationale:
We chose to design the app this way to balance its functionality and ease of use.
We wanted the app to be able to handle multiple user profiles to maximize the
app’s utility, but we also wanted its implementation to be intuitive and uncluttered.
Additionally, sectioning off features into their own space within the app gives the
app a clear organizational format and a way for users to access features efficiently
and easily.

Areas for Improvement:
The current implementation of multiple profiles, while powerful for households
sharing a device, could create unnecessary complexity for single users. The
persistent profile selector and associated profile heading occupy valuable screen
real estate and add an extra layer of interaction that may confuse or frustrate
individual users. When a health tracking app is primarily personal - as many are -
having to navigate between profiles or constantly see unused profile options could
feel like interface clutter. This is particularly evident in how the system requires
profile awareness across all features (goals, fitness, etc.), where a single user must
repeatedly ensure they're working within their designated profile to prevent data
misplacement.
A potential solution might be to implement a "single user mode" during initial
setup, which would hide the profile-switching interface entirely and streamline the
experience for individual users. Alternatively, the app could default to a single
profile view with the option to enable multiple profiles only when needed,
following the principle of progressive disclosure. This would maintain the
functionality for households while simplifying the interface for individual users
who represent a significant portion of the target audience.
A few less fundamental things that we could implement in our design include
improvements to: data visualization, form layout, list management, and responsive
design.
For data visualization, the progress tracking section could benefit from better
vertical organization of historical data. Currently, the app lacks robust visualization
tools that could show trends over time in a vertically scrollable format. Data
visualization is a useful measure of progress and a valuable tool for users.
For a grouped form layout, we can alter the existing vertically organized form
layout into a more intuitive grouped layout. This would be beneficial because
similar fields will be grouped together and would be more clearly organized. For
example, fitness tracking could group strength exercises separately from cardio
activities, with clear visual separation.
For list management, we can add sorting and filtering options that would make it
easier for users to categorize entries and find what they are looking for. At the
moment, all entries are simply listed with no options for the user to change what is
included or its ordering.
For responsive design, we could ensure that the app is adaptable to different screen
sizes. Some elements, particularly the input forms and lists, could be more
responsive to maintain usability on both narrow mobile screens and wide desktop
displays.
